        These transit curves were taken using my seestar s50 in eq mode at 20 second exposures, I then processed them using Siril and fit the model using astroimageJ.

        <p>These two are just the raw data along with the magnitude error</p>

        <p>This shows a regular offset gaussian curve that shows the general position of the curve</p>

        <p>This is a 4th degree polynomial fit of the curve</p>

        <p>This 5th degree polynomial I believe best represents the transit curve despite the noise that snuck into it</p>
        <p> being the first exoplanet I ever photographed I don't really know whether this is the actual curve or not, but wither way it is pretty impressive that people are taking these with the seestar s50.</p>
