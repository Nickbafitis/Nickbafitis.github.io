            <p >This image was taken with a zwo seestar s50,<br> 
                and I know it's not the best<br>
                 but considering I took it in bortle 8 skies I would say it's pretty decent,<br> 
                 I don't like the noise though<br>
                  and that might be due to the light pollution according to what some are telling me</p>
